# ReviewGraphQl

**ReviewGraphQl** provides endpoints for getting and creating the Product reviews by guest and logged in customers.

This is a port of Magento 2.4.1 code for 2.3.x versions.

## Note

For now, one must duplicate the [Config.php](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/32ed03cad4f2b2abc6ca6e5dc14885cd822c4508/app/code/Magento/Review/Model/Review/Config.php) file in its local project.

It is automatically applied if your project [supports composer patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches).
